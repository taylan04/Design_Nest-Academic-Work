Project Design Nest: In Development

The Design Nest project is currently under development as part of my academic activities during the 2024.2 semester at college. 
This website is an initiative aimed at providing a platform for selling graphic design products, such as banners, flyers, visual identities, 
and other design-related items. It is important to note that the site will not be real and will be developed solely for academic evaluation.

Throughout this semester, I am exploring various aspects of design, user experience, and the functionalities that can be incorporated into the 
site to make it dynamic and engaging. I am developing Design Nest using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows me to have complete control 
over the structure, style, and interactivity of the website.

In addition to working on the user interface and overall customer experience, I am integrating features that will allow visitors to easily navigate 
through the available products. This includes creating a visually appealing showcase to display the graphic design products and implementing a secure
payment system to facilitate purchases.

Keeping up with market trends and user needs is essential for the success of Design Nest. Therefore, I am conducting research and usability testing to 
ensure that the site not only stands out visually but also functions effectively. This project is an opportunity to apply what I have learned in class 
and to explore new techniques and tools that are essential in the modern design world.

As the semester progresses, I am excited to see Design Nest develop further. I hope to present a site that reflects my creative vision and technical skills, 
while also serving as an efficient platform for selling graphic design products. I look forward to sharing the progress and final results of this project while 
learning from the practical experience of developing it in an academic environment.
